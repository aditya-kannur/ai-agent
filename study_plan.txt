	* Try to implement a simple counter or a form with React state.
3. **Evening** (1 hour):
	* Review the concepts of state and props, and try to identify when to use each.
	* Research and take notes on React's lifecycle methods (e.g., `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`).

**Day 3: Props and Event Handling**

1. **Morning** (1 hour):
	* Learn about props and how to pass data from a parent component to a child component.
	* Watch a video on React props, such as this one by FreeCodeCamp (30 minutes).
2. **Afternoon** (2 hours):
	* Build a more complex React app with multiple components that pass props to each other.
	* Learn about event handling in React and how to use the `addEventListener` method.
	* Try to implement a simple form validation using React events.
3. **Evening** (1 hour):
	* Review the concepts of props and event handling, and try to implement a simple React app that uses both.
	* Research and take notes on React's context API and how it can be used to share data between components.

Remember to take breaks, practice what you've learned, and have fun exploring React!
